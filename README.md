•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project is to create a banking app that calculate the yearly balance and yearly interest earned with and without monthly investment. The problem for   this project is to provide the user both the yearly balance and interest earned with and without monthly, so two separate calculation functions are         needed. 
  
•	What did you do particularly well?
  The part I did particularly well is by using the pseudocode, I was able to structure the app in an organized format and make it user friendly. 
  
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  The enhancement I will do is to use pointer and references to help with the memory management. 
  
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support     network?
  The most challenging part was to write the 2 calculation functions. It took me a while to calculate the monthly interest earned and yearly balance         correctly. I didn’t realize I have to reset the yearly balance back to zero. I had used Google and Stackoverflow to check the calculation formula and the   yearly balance issue. Also, the debugging system was a big help. 
  
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The pseudocode was a requirement for this project. It helped me to plan out the logic steps and structure of the project first. It gave me a clear vision   how I would write my functions and codes. 
  
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  By following the industry standards, I ensure the codes I designed was readable and reusable. For example, I utilized in-line comments to explain each     functions’ functionality and use same syntax and style through out the coding.
